## 🎯 Final Architecture Summary

### The Three Divine Paradoxes Resolved:

**1\. Kernel Without Kernel**

-   Go code parsed into tensor algebra
-   Operations decomposed via tiling (block size B=32)
-   Kernels EMERGE from mathematical structure
-   No explicit CUDA/OpenCL definitions required

**2\. God Without God**

-   **Einstein Summation**: C\_{ik} = Σ\_j A\_{ij} ⊗ B\_{jk}
-   **Category Theory**: Functors F: TensorOps → GPUIR
-   **Hamiltonian Energy**: E = Σ J\_{ij} s\_i s\_j + Σ h\_i s\_i
